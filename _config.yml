          Hi!

          I am Data Scientist @ Hyperlex, a SaaS Contract Management Platform driven by AI.
          Here, I ensure the continuous improvement of the AI engine of our main product.
          In parallel, I manage several PoC projects to solve our customers' challenges ranging from
          NLP to Computer Vision applied to legal document analysis.

          Prior to this position, I graduated from MINES ParisTech and from Master MVA (ENS Paris Saclay).
          This gave me strong technical (computer vision, NLP, statistical learning) and managerial
          (project management in a research/technical environment) skills.
