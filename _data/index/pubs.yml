  desc: >
          In this paper, we propose a new approach for searching action
          proposals in unconstrained videos. Our method first produces
          snippet action proposals by combining YOLO detector and our regression
          based RNN detector. Then, these short action proposals are
          integrated to form final action proposals by solving two-pass
          dynamic programming which maximizes actioness score and temporal smoothness concurrently.
